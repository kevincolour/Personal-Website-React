# Intro

It's not everyday I get to talk about myself. In fact, it's today.

# Some history

I immigrated to Canada from South Korea when I was six years old. I went to school, then more school, then even more school. Then I wrote apps, then more apps, and now am writing even more apps.

# Currently

I'm just trying to sort the grey from the blacks, finding the perfect smiley face emoji, and figuring out which surf is up next! 

# I dream of

truth and sanity. I dream of light in the night, of gentle breezes in the cold. To dream is to want and to want is to exist.

# Fun facts

Fun facts are reservered for (emotionally)paying subscribers(friends). If you feel as though you have earned this honour, take a long look in the mirror and wonder what other lies you keep telling yourself, and which of your life choices have led you to this very moment where you desperatly cling on to your tears in horrid disgrace
